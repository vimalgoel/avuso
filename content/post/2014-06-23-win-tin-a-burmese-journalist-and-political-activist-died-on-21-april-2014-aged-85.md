IN SEPTEMBER 2008, as hundreds of prisoners were let out of Insein jail in Myanmar’s former capital, Yangon, one small, elderly, wavy-haired figure continued to stand by the gates. He had not changed into civvies, or taken his things; he still wore his blue prison shirt. Win Tin was refusing to take part in the amnesty, arranged by Myanmar’s military regime, on principle. If he accepted it, that implied he also accepted the charges he had first been locked up for almost 20 years before, mostly opposition activism and satires against the regime in his bestselling newspaper, the Hanthawaddy Daily. The petty criminals who raced past him were expected not to misbehave again. He was different, and ill as he was—with a dozen complaints left untreated in prison—he intended to misbehave just as he had before. Only when he had made that point clear to the warders, as evening fell, did he walk away. He was still wearing the blue shirt.

Every year he was invited to make peace with the regime. He always refused, though with a courteous smile. General Ne Win had tried to be friends before he went to jail, inviting him to dinner and so forth, but he was unswayed.

Since he had never married, and had lost all his property while in prison, he spent his last years in a two-room cabin in the garden of a friend. It was stuffed with books and ever open to visitors, but those who called would find him still in a blue prisoner’s shirt. He wore no other sort. For despite the reforms and the lifting of Western sanctions, the generals had not yet apologised and Myanmar was not yet free. In his own words, therefore, **“I decline my release, /I am prepared to stay."**
