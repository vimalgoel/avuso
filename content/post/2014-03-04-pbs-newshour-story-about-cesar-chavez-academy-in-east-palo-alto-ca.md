JUDY WOODRUFF:
Back in this country, we turn to a classroom program designed to help young people cope with PTSD, a condition caused not by the shock of war, but by the stresses they encounter in life outside their schools.
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

>JEFFREY BROWN:
Cesar Chavez is in a low-income, high-crime neighborhood, and many of these students face real-world stresses, anxieties and fears, which can impair their ability to learn.

>
JEFFREY BROWN:
He showed us brain images of children who suffer from chronic press, revealing evidence of both cognitive impairment and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

>This link between stress and behavior actually shows up in the brain?

>DR. VICTOR CARRION:
It does.

>JEFFREY BROWN:
And, so, when there is stress or trauma in somebody's life, it shows up there?

>DR. VICTOR CARRION:
Well, yes, what we can see is there is a deficit in the area of the middle frontal cortex in kids that have PTSD.

I volunteered at this school for one semester a few years ago.
