I heard about Ashok Krish on [PRI's The World](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-10-03/classical-indian-musician-transforming-hit-songs-pop-parodies):
Ashok Krish is one of those who can not only spot similarities, but reshape an entire tune — across genres, styles and cultures.
I first heard of him when someone forwarded me his take on Adele’s 007 theme song, Skyfall. There are any number of cover versions of the song — from a rock take to the Russian Army Band’s interpretation and everything in between.
But Ashok’s is likely the first that sets it to a classical Carnatic raga.

and here's a haunting tune:

Thumbi Vaa (Gum sum gum, Sangatthil Paadatha Kavithai) - A violin and flute version of the Harmonize Projekt's version of the Ilayaraja classic in collaboration with Vijay Kannan.

* Thumbi Va - Malayalam
* Sangatthil Paadaatha - Tamil
* Aakasam Yenatidho - Telugu
* Gum sum gum - Hindi
