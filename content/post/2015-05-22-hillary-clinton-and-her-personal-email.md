Hillary Clinton was never assigned a @state.gov email address and, apparently, did not ask for one. When one joins an organization, there is a process of "onboarding". Email address is one of the many things done along with payroll, keys, badges, etc.

This always entitled queen did not do what any normal person has to go through. She ran a mail server at her house not caring or not comprehending that keeping it secure is a very daunting task. What were the motives? Secrecy? Thumbing her nose at the norms which should have applied to her? It is OK for NSA to get hold of citizens' records but hers are going to be controlled by her. I bet the foreign security agencies found it easy to penetrate her servers. Can you imagine the Australian Foreign Minister saying to her, "Let me think about it, I will send you an email. What is your address?" She: "hillary@clinitonmail.com".

I am angry that a person in her position could flout rules like that. If it was not a criminal offense, it ought to have been. We have had too much of the VIP syndrome in this world. Equality, I say.

I am not likely to ever vote for a Republican. If she is the nominee of the Democrats, I will throw away my vote in favor of a minor party.
__Updated__: I voted for her. In light of what has happened since, it was the only correct decision.
