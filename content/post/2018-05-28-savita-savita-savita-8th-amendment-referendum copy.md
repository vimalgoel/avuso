[Blog post by __Una Mullally__ in the __Irish Times__](https://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2012/11/14/savitahalappanavar/) after the death of the death of Savita Halappanavar.

>By now much of Ireland, and a good chunk of elsewhere, knows about the death of Savita Halappanavar.

>Kitty Holland and Paul Cullen wrote in Wednesday’s Irish Times newspaper, “Two investigations are under way into the death of a woman who was 17 weeks pregnant, at University Hospital Galway last month. Savita Halappanavar (31), a dentist, presented with back pain at the hospital on October 21st, was found to be miscarrying, and died of septicaemia a week later. Her husband, Praveen Halappanavar (34), an engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, says she asked several times over a three-day period that the pregnancy be terminated. He says that, having been told she was miscarrying, and after one day in severe pain, Ms Halappanavar asked for a medical termination.”
