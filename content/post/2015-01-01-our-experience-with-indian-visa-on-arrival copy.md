We recently traveled to India with our son who did not have an Indian visa. The Indian Visa on Arrival scheme was introduced in the past few months and we weren't sure whether it would work well. I first tried to get a regular entry visa for him by applying [online](https://www.in.ckgs.us/visa/) but found the process daunting. Too many inane questions, too many hoops to go through. I decided to take a chance on applying for "Visa on Arrival". The name is a misnomer: you have to apply and receive the authorization while abroad. You can't arrive in India and expect to get your visa there.
Update: It is now called [e-Visa](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html)

The application for getting an Indian Visa on Arrival is relatively straightforward. Only one question would have have been difficult to answer if you had last visited India 20 years earlier:

It took 3 days to get the visa: hurricane speed in the annals of Indian bureaucracy. I printed it out. It did not look impressive enough and I wondered if the airline would turn him away at SFO. No problem was encountered. After we arrived in India, we found that there were separate lines for visitors with Visa on Arrival paper. We asked our son to stand in one of those lines while we passed immigration using ordinary lines for foreign passport holders. That could have turned into a serious mistake. Had something gone wrong with his entry, we could not have come back in to help him. It would have been advisable for us to have waited inside until he had cleared immigration.
