[Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End](https://amzn.com/0805095152)


p33

> "It turns out that inheritance has surprisingly little influence on longevity…"
“… only 3% of how long you’ll live, compared with the average, is explained by your parents’ longevity; by contrast, up to 90% of how tall you are is explained by your parents’ height."

p40

> “You must always examine the feet” of an elderly person. They might reveal neglect if they have not been kept clean. "The doctor inspected them inch by inch — the soles, the toes, the web spaces."

p47

> “He stayed in medical practice after the attack, multiple hernia repairs, gallbladder surgery, arthritis that all but ended his avid piano playing, compression fractures of his aging spine that stole three full inches of his five-foot-seven-inch height, and hearing loss.”

p51

> “As you get older, the lordosis of your spine tips your head forward, so when you look straight ahead it’s like looking up there ceiling for anyone else. Try to swallow while looking up; you’ll choke once in a while. The problem is common in the elderly.”

p79

> “Your chances of avoiding the nursing home is directly related to how many children you have, and according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.”

p84

> “Eventually he was diagnosed with postural hypotension — a condition of old age in which the body loses its ability to maintain adequate blood pressure for brain function during change in position."

p179

> "End of Life wishes:
1. Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops?
2. Do you want aggressive treatments such as intubation and mechanical ventilation?
3. Do you want antibiotics?
4. Do you want tube or intravenous feeding if you can’t eat on your own?"
