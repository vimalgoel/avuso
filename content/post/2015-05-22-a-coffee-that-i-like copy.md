A supermarket near us closed when the management decided to pull out of the West Coast. I bought a lot of different brands of coffee when they had their closeout sale. The one that impressed me the most is [Dallmayr Espresso Monaco](https://www.dallmayr.com/coffee/our-range-by-method/for-fully-automatic-machines/espresso-monaco/).
I look forward to returning to Munich some day and enjoy a treat at their [delicatessen](https://www.dallmayr.com/delicatessen/shop/).
